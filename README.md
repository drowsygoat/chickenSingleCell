# chickenSingleCell

`chickenSingleCell` provides workflows and utilities for single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis in chicken, including preprocessing for downstream eQTL mapping.

---

## Installation

You can install the latest version of `chickenSingleCell` directly from GitHub using the **devtools** package:

    # Install devtools if you don't have it
    install.packages("devtools")

    # Install chickenSingleCell from GitHub
    devtools::install_github("drowsygoat/chickenSingleCell")

---

## ArchR workflow

The ArchR-based single-cell ATAC-seq workflow is provided in:

    `workflows/archR_workflow.R`

Arrow files are generated with the helper script:
    `insta/aux/module_make_arrows.sh`
The final object used for **eQTL analysis** is a `SummarizedExperiment` produced by the `getGroupSE()` function.

---

## Seurat workflow

The single-cell RNA-seq workflow is implemented in:

    `workflows/seurat_workflow.R`

The final object used for **eQTL analysis** is a `SummarizedExperiment` generated by `AverageExpressionPerClusterPerSample()`.

---

## Outputs

Both workflows produce standardized `SummarizedExperiment` objects that is directly used as input for Matrix eQTL analysis using wrapperQTL.
